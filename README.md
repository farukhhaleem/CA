Virtualisation and VM

A virtual machine (VM) is an operating system (OS) or application environment that is installed on software, which imitates dedicated hardware. The end user has the same experience on a virtual machine as they would have on dedicated hardware
When we describe VirtualBox as a "virtualization" product, we refer to "full virtualization", that is, the particular kind of virtualization that allows an unmodified operating system with all of its installed software to run in a special environment, on top of your existing operating system. This environment, called a "virtual machine", is created by the virtualization software by intercepting access to certain hardware components and certain features. The physical computer is then usually called the "host", while the virtual machine is often called a "guest". Most of the guest code runs unmodified, directly on the host computer, and the guest operating system "thinks" it's running on real machine.

This approach, often called "native virtualization", is different from mere emulation. With that approach, as performed by programs such as BOCHS, guest code is not allowed to run directly on the host. Instead, every single machine instruction is translated, While emulators theoretically allow running code written for one type of hardware on completely different hardware (say, running 64-bit code on 32-bit hardware), they are typically quite slow. Virtualizers such as VirtualBox, on the other hand, can achieve near-native performance for the guest code, but can only run guest code that was written for the same target hardware (such as 32-bit Linux on a 32-bit Windows host
Download and install virtual box 
Open the VMs and Services workspace.
On the Home tab, click the Create Virtual Machine drop-down arrow, and then click Create Virtual Machine.
The Create Virtual Machine Wizard opens.
On the Select Source page, click Create the new virtual machine with a blank virtual hard disk, and then click next.
Specify identity options as follows, and then click next:
With VMM in System Center 2012 SP1 or System Center 2012, on the Specify Virtual Machine Identity page, enter the virtual machine name and optional description.

web server 
A web server is a PC framework that procedures demands by means of HTTP, the essential system convention used to convey data on the World Wide Web. The term can allude to the whole framework, or particularly to the product that acknowledges and oversees the HTTP asks.
PC framework whose basic role will be to unite with the web What's more with download put away webpages Furthermore files looking into of the client (client) workstations The point when accessed alternately asked. A solitary web server might backing numerous websites, alternately a absolute website might a chance to be facilitated on a few connected or reflected web servers.
Apache Web Server
Apache will be those the vast majority broadly utilized web server programming. Produced What's more administered Eventually Tom's perusing apache programming Foundation, apache may be a open sourball product accessible free of charge. It runs looking into 67% of know webservers in the planet. It is fast, reliable, Furthermore secure
Apache Web Server is an open source Web server creation, organization and administration programming. At first created by a gathering of programming developers, it is currently kept up by the Apache Software Foundation. 

Starting at 2013, with more than 100 million sites and more than 50 percent of the worldwide piece of the pie, Apache Web Server is a standout amongst the most normally utilized applications for site facilitating.
Design the essential settings under the principle tab. 

Click on the Virtual Hosts tab and design those default settings. 

Under those Virtual Hosts tab, design the default Virtual group. 

In you need to serve more than particular case url alternately virtual host, include those extra virtual hosts.
Setup and Configuration of Apache
Webserver

Design the server settings under the server tab. 

Design the associations settings under the execution tuning tab. 

Duplicate every one necessary files of the DocumentRoot Also cgi-bin directories. 

Retreat the provision Also select will save your settings.
Reflection
Download the wrong virtual machine as I did not have the copy that you give in the class.
Conclusion
Creating a virtual machine using ubunto is just a first step towards using the actual modern operating system on virtual machine and can be used in many ways.
